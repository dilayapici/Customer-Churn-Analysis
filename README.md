![Alt Text](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f1fd679c4049d7bec674c92/960x0.gif?fit=scale)

This project is a binary classification problem. The aim of this project is to predict the customers that we will lose. Data consists of 51,047 instances and 58 attributes. If we focus on company goals, actually our problem is losing customers. In this situation the company needs to find churned customer in other words the customers that we will lose. Thus, the company will avoid losing profit and revenue.
